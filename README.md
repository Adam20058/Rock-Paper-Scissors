## Demo

## How it Works

<div>
  <b>Objective of the game</b><br/>
  <p>It's a zero-sum game where 2 players face-off by choosing one the three possible shapes. And the winner is decided according to a circular hierarchy of the shapes</p>
  <p>The 3 possible shapes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rock</li>
<li>Paper</li>
<li>Scissors</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
  <b>Rules of Hierarchy</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>Rock always beat scissors, but rock loses to paper</li>
<li>Paper always beats rock, But paper loses to scissors</li>
<li>Scissors beats paper, but scissors loses to rock</li>
<li>If both shapes are the same there is a draw</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
  <b>Rules of Outcome</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>Outcome 1: Player 1 Wins and Player 2 loses</li>
<li>Outcome 2: Player 1 loses and Player 2 wins</li>
<li>Outcome 3: A draw between Player 1 and Player 2</li>
</ul>
</div>
